## Installation Instructions

### 1.Clone the Repository
In your terminal, use the commands to clone the repository & navigate into the project folder

```
git clone https://github.com/EmmaMan23/BookShare-Flask
cd BookShare-Flask
```

### 2.Create a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment 
#### For Mac/Linux
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
#### For Windows
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 3.Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set Environment Variables
This application uses environment variables to manage sensitive information and configuration settings. 
These variables are stored in a file named .env, which has not been committed for security reasons.
To configure the application you will need to create your own .env file.

To set up your .env file:
1.Copy the example environment file in the repository using the following command:
```
cp .env.example .env

```
2. The contents of the example file look like this 
```
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///app.db
ADMIN_CODE=your_admin_code
```

3. Open the `.env` file in a text editor and update the following variables:

`SECRET_KEY` Used for securely signing session data
`DATABASE_URL` Path to the SQLite database (leave as is unless using a different database)
`ADMIN_CODE` The special code used for validating admins during registration

4. Save the `.env` file. The application will automatically load these settings when it runs


>[!IMPORTANT]
>Before running the app: Ensure you replace your_secret_key and your_admin_code with your own secure values.
>These values are not provided in the repository for security reasons.
>Do not share or commit your .env file to any public repository. 



### Database Setup
This application uses an SQLite database, which is lightweight and does not require a separate database server.

The database file will be created automatically when you run the application for the first time (if it doesnâ€™t already exist). The schema will also be created automatically. The default database file path is specified in your .env file under the `DATABASE_URL` variable (e.g., sqlite:///app.db).


### Running the application

After activating your virtual environment and installing dependencies, start the app:
```
python3 main.py
```
This will launch the Flask development server locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default
You can open this URL in your browser to use the application. 
To stop the server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal (works on both Mac and Windows).


### Testing Instructions
This project uses `pytest` for both unit tests and integration tests.
Make sure you are in the project root directory before running the tests. 

Run Tests (Mac/Linux):
`PYTHONPATH=. pytest`

Run Tests (Windows CMD):
```
set PYTHONPATH=.
pytest
```
Run Tests (Windows PowerShell):
```
$env:PYTHONPATH="."
pytest
```

### Deployment
Deployment for this application is not yet complete. The project is intended to be deployed using Render, a cloud platform that supports Flask applications.
